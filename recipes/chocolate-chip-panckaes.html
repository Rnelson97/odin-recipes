<p>Indulge in a delightful breakfast treat with these fluffy chocolate chip pancakes. These mouthwatering pancakes are a perfect blend of light, airy batter and rich, melty chocolate chips, making each bite a heavenly experience.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
  <li>1 large egg</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li>
  <li>Additional chocolate chips for topping (optional)</li>
  <li>Maple syrup or whipped cream for serving (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
  <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg and then add buttermilk, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
  <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.</li>
  <li>Gently fold in the chocolate chips into the batter.</li>
  <li>Preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat and lightly grease it with butter or cooking spray.</li>
  <li>Using a ladle or measuring cup, pour a portion of the batter onto the skillet to form pancakes of your desired size.</li>
  <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancakes, then flip and cook until the other side is golden brown. This should take about 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
  <li>Remove the pancakes from the skillet and keep them warm while you cook the remaining batter.</li>
  <li>Serve the chocolate chip pancakes hot, topped with additional chocolate chips, maple syrup, or a dollop of whipped cream if desired. Enjoy!</li>
