   <h2>Description</h2>

   <p><strong>Beef enchiladas</strong> are a <em>savory</em> and <em>satisfying</em> Mexican dish that combines tender, seasoned beef with a flavorful tomato-based sauce, all wrapped up in soft corn tortillas. To prepare this delicious recipe, start by browning ground beef with onions and garlic, then add a blend of spices like cumin, chili powder, and paprika to infuse it with rich, smoky flavors. After simmering the beef in a tomato sauce until it's tender and well-cooked, you'll fill each tortilla with a generous portion of the beef mixture, roll it up, and place it seam-side down in a baking dish. Top the enchiladas with more sauce and a generous amount of shredded cheese, then bake until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Serve these beef enchiladas with a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkle of fresh cilantro, and perhaps some sliced jalapeños for an irresistible meal that's sure to please your taste buds.</p>
